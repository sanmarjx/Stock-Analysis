# Stock-Analysis With Excel VBA
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to obtain stock information from the year 2017 and 2018 and determine whether or not the stocks were a good investment. We want to refactor the code to make it more efficient by making it making it easier to read and taking fewer steps. We will be able to test if our code is running faster by checking the run time for each Macro.
### Results
#### Analysis
The project begins with a code that we copy and paste into VBA. We then refactor the code to make it more efficient. This is the process that we followed to improve the code.
##### 1. We created a ticker index and set it to 0. We also created the output arrays for the volume, starting price and ending price.
